# Popoki
Popoki is a faster Wordle solver built in Rust using Information Theory. The name "Popoki" comes from the Hawaiian word for "cat" because, just like a cat, Popoki is quick and nimble when it comes to solving Wordles.

## How it Works
Popoki uses an algorithm based on Information Theory to quickly narrow down the possible solutions for a given Wordle puzzle. It works by analyzing the frequency of each letter in the puzzle, comparing it to the frequency of letters in common English words, and using that information to eliminate unlikely combinations of letters. This process is repeated until the solution is found, resulting in a much faster solve time than traditional methods.

## How to Use
Popoki is a command-line tool.
